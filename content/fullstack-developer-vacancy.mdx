### Hi, I'm [Mark](https://markinger.tech), the CEO of [Pleep](https://pleep.app) ðŸ‘‹

We're looking for a part-time full-stack developer to join our team and help us build the future of AI assistants.

### What do we do?

[Pleep](https://pleep.app) is a service for creating AI assistants for businesses. We allow any business owner to create, train, and integrate a tailored AI assistant for their business into their product in just **under 30 minutes**.

We've completed multiple accelerators, such as the very selective [DOMiNO Ventures Accelerator](https://dominovc.com/news-detail/startupsgraduated) (only **four teams were selected** from Kazakhstan).

We recently raised a **pre-seed round of $5K** from [Nazarbayev University Research and Innovation System](https://nuris.nu.edu.kz/) and are currently in the process of raising more funds.

We have paying customers, and right now our main goal is to take our AI assistants to the **next level**. Our mission is to revolutionize the way people perceive AI assistants and utilize the latest AI technologies to help businesses earn more.

### Who are we looking for?

You are an ideal candidate if:

- You are **proactive**. You can outline the steps to achieve a goal on your own, and you don't require someone to give you a fully prepared step-by-step explanation of what you need to do.
- You are **willing to learn**. We don't require you to know everything, but by joining us, you'll need to learnâ€”**learn a lot**.
- You have a **good taste in UI/UX** and you're **ready to improve it**. You can create a good-looking UI without a designer's help. At Pleep, we develop UI on-the-go, which allows us to **move much faster**.
- You have development **(not necessarily commercial)** experience with React.js, Next.js 14, and Express.js. You know TypeScript, have a strong foundation in JavaScript, and know how to write clean code.

You must know:

- JavaScript, TypeScript, Next.js 14, React.js, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express.js.

It would be great if you know (and it's fine if you don't):

- TailwindCSS, PrismaORM or TypeORM, shadcn/ui.

### Conditions & Offer

The position is **unpaid** with the opportunity to **receive equity** in the company. We will also provide you with the necessary tools and resources to work effectively, along with certification of your work.

Here are the conditions:

- You'll work **4 hours/day, 20 hours/week**.
- Work is **fully remote**. You **must** have your own laptop and the necessary conditions for work.
- We'll cover the cost of any online software you'll need for work. We also have access to many paid services that you can use for free.
- You will be able to receive up to **1.5% equity** in the company (depends on how you perform in the first month).
- Salary will be discussed individually (depends on your experience, skills, and how much you're willing to work).
