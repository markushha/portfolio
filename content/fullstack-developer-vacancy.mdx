### Hi, I'm [Mark](https://markinger.tech), the CEO of [Pleep](https://pleep.app) ðŸ‘‹

We're looking for a part-time full-stack developer to join our team and help us build the future of AI assistants

### What do we do?

[Pleep](https://pleep.app) is a service for creating AI assistants for businesses. We allow any business owner to create, train, and integrate a tailored AI assistant for their business into their product in just **under 30 minutes**.

We've completed multiple accelerators, such as the very selective [DOMiNO Ventures Accelerator](https://dominovc.com/news-detail/startupsgraduated) (only **4 teams were selected** from Kazakhstan).

We recently raised a **pre-seed round for $5K** from [Nazarbayev University Research and Innovation System](https://nuris.nu.edu.kz/) and are currently in the process of raising more funds.

We have paying customers and right now our main goal is to take our AI assistants to the **next level**. Our mission is to revolutionize the way people see AI assistants and utilize the latest AI technologies to help businesses earn more.

### Who are we looking for?

You are an ideal candidate if:

- you are **pro-active**. You can outline the steps to achieve a goal on your own and you don't require someone to give you a fully ready step-by-step explanation of what you need to do
- you are **willing to learn**. We don't require you to know everything. But by joining us, you'll need to learn - **learn a lot**
- you have a **good taste in UI/UX** & you're **ready to improve it**. You can make a good-looking UI without a designer's help. At Pleep, we develop UI on-the-go - it allows us to **move much faster**.
- you have development **(not necessarily commercial)** experience with React.js, Next.js 14, & Express.js. You know Typescript, have great fundamentals in JavaScript, and know how to write clean code

You must know:
- JavaScript, Typescript, Next.js 14, React.js, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express.js

It would be cool if you know (and it's fine if you don't):
- TailwindCSS, PrismaORM or TypeORM, shadcn/ui

### Conditions & offer

We offer you a **paid position** with the ability to **receive equity** in the company. We're looking for a part-time developer, but if you're willing to work full-time - we're open to discussion.

Here are the conditions:

- You'll work **4 hours/day, 20 hours/week**
- Work is **fully remote**. You **must** have your own laptop and necessary conditions for work
- We'll cover the cost of any online software you'll need for work. We also have access to a lot of paid services that you can use for free
- You will be able to get up to **1.5% equity** in the company (depends on how you display yourself in the first month)
- Salary will be discussed individually (depends on your experience, skills, and how much you're willing to work)
