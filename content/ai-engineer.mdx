### Hi, I'm Mark, CEO @ [Pleep](https://pleep.app) ðŸ‘‹

We're looking for a full-time AI engineer to join our team and help us on a mission to integrate AI into millions of businesses without a single prompt.

### **What do we do?**

**At [Pleep](https://pleep.app/), we are on a mission to make it possible for any business owner to integrate AI into their business without writing a single prompt.** With a current focus on sales reps, we enable every business owner to create an AI sales rep in just 5 minutes â€” no knowledge required at all.

Our benchmark is human â€” that's why our AI sales reps not only text but also talk while maintaining unified context. Now we're working on the complete independence of our agents, and that's why we need you.

Numbers-wise, we have raised $100K in a pre-seed round and received over $15K in grants. We have more than 200 paying customers and a 105% month-to-month growth rate. We work with such cool guys as EasyTap, ProsperPay, Squares.kz, Outpeer.kz, and others.

All of the above were achieved locally in Kazakhstan and we're just getting started. Right now we're hacking growth limits and next on our list is to become a global player.

### **Who are we looking for?**

You are an ideal candidate if:

- You are **proactive**. You have a goal and you just execute. You don't require someone to give you a fully prepared step-by-step explanation of what you need to do.
- You have strong real-world experience in building AI/ML powered apps.
- You are **willing to learn**. We don't require you to be senior ML dev, but by joining us, you'll need to **learn a lot**.
- You know how to conduct good, solid **research** (cuz these days stuff changes so fast)

You must:

- know Russian and English (B1+)
- live in Almaty
- know Python with FastAPI or TypeScript with Next.js
- have experience with LangChain or any other LLM framework
- have experience building RAG / CAG systems
- know how to prompt engineer with techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT)

It would be great if you (and it's fine if you don't):

- have fundamental understanding of NLP
- have trained your own LM from the ground up
- have built any kind of AI agents
- have worked with MCP or/and with recent A2A protocol

### **Conditions & Offer**

The position is paid, and you also have the opportunity to **receive equity** in the company if you crush it and take us to the next level.

Here are the conditions:

- You'll work 8 hours/day, 40 hours/week. We also would like you to overwork on Saturdays, but it's up to you (of course, you get more if you work more). More than half the team works both Saturdays and Sundays, with no days off.
- Work is in the office (SmArt Point). You **must** have your own laptop and the necessary conditions for work.

  Besides work, we also play basketball, pool, eat lunches, go to the gym (there is a gym), etc. So it's fun here.

- We'll cover the cost of any online software you'll need for work. We also have access to many paid services that you can use for free (Cursor Pro, etc.)
- You will have a 2-month trial. After the trial, you have an opportunity to get equity via vesting, but the decision is up to me (again, if you crush it, you get it).
- Salary will be discussed individually and depends **heavily** on your experience. But to have an overall understanding, we are committed to paying you from 400,000 KZT up to 800,000 KZT.

### **Apply Now**

To apply, please send your experience (it can be a CV or just plain text describing what you've been doing and what you're looking for) & GitHub to mark@pleep.app or [**Telegram**](https://t.me/marx2do).

Waiting for your application!

Best regards,
Mark
